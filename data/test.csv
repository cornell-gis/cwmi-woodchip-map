There are numerous sites on campus that are now sorting their food/landscaping waste for composting: Campus House Restaurant, Caudell Hall Food Labs, Campus Dining Services & the Grounds Department. Each of the sites generates compostables and deposits them into 35 gal totes on wheels that are put out to the curb twice a week for pickup by CAO. The first week of the campus wide program began on April 1st , 2013 and has been a  great success.   The campus participation in this program has been outstanding and it continues to grow.
